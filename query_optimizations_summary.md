# Database Query Optimizations Summary

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. bot/handlers/admin_handlers.py
- **Line 31-32**: Added `select_related('master')` to `get_all_feedback()` query
  - This prevents N+1 queries when accessing master information in feedback listing

### 2. bot/handlers/booking.py
- **Line 33-34**: Added `select_related('salon').prefetch_related('services')` to `get_master()` query
  - Prevents additional queries when accessing master's salon and services
- **Line 45-47**: Added `prefetch_related('services')` to `get_master_services()` query
  - Optimizes fetching master's services in one query
- **Line 50-56**: Added `select_related('salon')` to `get_master_salon()` query
  - Prevents additional query when accessing master's salon
- **Line 334-336**: Added `select_related('salon').prefetch_related('services')` to master lookup query
  - Optimizes the fallback master selection when no master is specified

### 3. bot/keyboards.py
- **Line 26-28**: Added `prefetch_related('services')` to `get_master_services()` query
  - Optimizes fetching master's services
- **Line 32-36**: Added `select_related('salon')` to `get_master_salon()` query
  - Prevents additional query for salon data
- **Line 39-43**: Added `prefetch_related('masters')` to `get_services_by_salon()` query
  - Optimizes access to masters providing each service
- **Line 57-58**: Added `select_related('salon').prefetch_related('services')` to `get_masters_by_salon()` query
  - Prevents N+1 queries when displaying master information with their salons and services

### 4. bot/services.py
- **Line 5-6**: Added `select_related('salon').prefetch_related('services')` to `get_active_masters()` query
  - Optimizes fetching all active masters with their related data
- **Line 17-19**: Added `prefetch_related('services')` to `get_master_services()` query
  - Optimizes fetching master's services
- **Line 22-24**: Added `select_related('salon')` to `get_master_salons()` query
  - Prevents additional query for salon data

## Already Optimized Queries

The following queries were already properly optimized:
- `bot/handlers/admin_handlers.py`: `get_all_appointments()` - uses `select_related('client', 'master', 'service', 'salon')`
- `bot/handlers/common.py`: `get_client_appointments()` - uses `select_related('service', 'master', 'salon')`
- `bot/handlers/common.py`: Admin appointments and feedback queries - properly use `select_related`
- `bot/handlers/payment.py`: `get_appointment()` - uses `select_related('master', 'client', 'service')`

## Performance Impact

These optimizations will significantly reduce the number of database queries by:
1. Preventing N+1 query problems in loops that access related models
2. Fetching all required data in a single query using JOIN operations (select_related)
3. Efficiently prefetching many-to-many relationships (prefetch_related)

This is especially important for admin handlers that list multiple records and could potentially make hundreds of queries without these optimizations.
